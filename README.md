# 3DFaceReconstruction
The implementation of the 3D face reconstruction through Resnet and BFM model, for the course project.
## Preparing environment
use Singularity on linux(with GPU)
## Preparing Dataset
Download and unzip the CACD original face from 
>Original face images (detected and croped by openCV face detector) can be downloaded [here] (3.5G)
>
Modify the corrsponding path in the 'Dataprepocessing.py' run `python Dataprepocessing.py`

## Training the model
Check the path in and run `python Trainnet.py`
## Testing the model and get outcome
Check the path in and run `python Trainnet.py`
